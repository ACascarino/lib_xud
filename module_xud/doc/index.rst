XMOS USB Device (XUD) Library
=============================

This document details the use of the XMOS USB Device (XUD) Library.  This library enables the development of USB 2.0 devices on the XMOS XS-1 architecture.

This document describes the structure of the library, its basic use, and
resources required. A worked example that uses the XUD library is shown:
a USB Human Interface Device (HID) Class compliant mouse. The full source
code for the example can be downloaded from the XMOS website.

This document assumes familiarity with the XMOS XS-1 architecture, the
Universal Serial Bus 2.0 Specification (and related specifications),
the XMOS tool chain and XC language.
