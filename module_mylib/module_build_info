# This module_build_info is for a module that builds to a library

# The LIBRARY variable needs to be set to the name of the library to
# be built

LIBRARY = mylib

# You can set flags specifically for your module by using the MODULE_XCC_FLAGS
# variable. So the following
#
#   MODULE_XCC_FLAGS = $(XCC_FLAGS) -O3
#
# specifies that everything in the modules should have the application
# build flags with -O3 appended (so the files will build at
# optimization level -O3).
#
# You can also set MODULE_XCC_C_FLAGS, MODULE_XCC_XC_FLAGS etc..

MODULE_XCC_FLAGS = -O3

# The EXPORT_SOURCE_DIRS variable are the directories that contain
# include files for the library and any source files that you do not
# want compiled into the library but supplied as source to the
# application using the module.

EXPORT_SOURCE_DIRS = include
